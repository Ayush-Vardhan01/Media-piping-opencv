Volume Control with OpenCV
This project leverages OpenCV and Python to create a gesture-based volume control system. Using hand gestures detected through your camera, the system can increase or decrease the volume on your device.

Features
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Uses OpenCV to detect hand movements.

Gesture Recognition: Specific gestures control volume levels.

Dynamic Adjustments: Volume changes in real-time based on gesture detection.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x

OpenCV

Numpy

Pycaw (Python Core Audio Windows Library, if on Windows)

Mediapipe (for hand tracking)
